# SH Automation Ninjas - Google Apps Scripts Automation

Hello, we are the SH Automation Ninjas - a team dedicated to automating repetitive tasks within StoreHub using Google Apps Scripts. This repository contains scripts we have generated with the help of ChatGPT. We're all beginners in the world of coding, but we're excited about the possibilities automation opens up!

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up GitHub**: If you haven't already, [set up your GitHub account](https://github.com/join). Make sure to configure your username and email so your contributions are correctly attributed.
2. **Join Our Team**: If you're an SH Automation Ninja and want to contribute, you'll need to:

   - Create a GitHub account, if you haven't already.
   - Request access to this repository. To do so, click on the 'Issues' tab in this repository, create a new issue, and use it to request access. Include your GitHub username in the request.

   The repository's administrator will then give you the necessary permissions to contribute. If you've done this and still can't access the repository, please contact the repository's administrator.
3. **Start the Training**: We've set up six self-service training sessions to help you learn the basics of using ChatGPT to create automations on Google Sheets via Google Apps Scripts. You can find the training materials in the `/training` directory in this repository.

## How to Contribute

We're all learning as we go, so here are some steps to help us work together effectively:

1. **Create a Directory**: If you're working on a new task, create a new directory for it. This keeps our scripts for different tasks separate and organized. For instance, if you're working on a task for removing duplicate emails, you might create a directory called "Duplicate Emails Removal".
2. **Make Your Changes**: Use ChatGPT to generate your code, then add it to your local copy of the repository within the appropriate directory. Make sure to test your changes thoroughly.
3. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you're happy with your changes, commit them. This saves your changes to your local copy of the repository.
4. **Push Your Changes**: After you've committed your changes, push them to GitHub. This will make your changes visible to everyone else on the team.
5. **Open a Pull Request**: Once your changes are on GitHub, open a pull request. This lets the team know you're ready to have your changes reviewed.
6. **Code Review**: Wait for your code to be reviewed by another team member. They might have questions or suggestions, so be ready to discuss your changes. Once your changes have been approved, they can be merged into the main project.

## Best Practices

* **Comment Your Code**: Comments help others understand what your code is supposed to do, especially important since we're new to this!
* **Test Thoroughly**: Before committing any changes, make sure your scripts work as expected.
* **Review Changes Carefully**: When reviewing someone else's code, take your time to understand the changes and test them if possible.
* **Keep Learning**: We're all new to this, so let's keep learning together. Share resources and ask questions whenever you need help.
